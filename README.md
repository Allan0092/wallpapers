## Ownership.
These wallpapers come from the internet. Diffusion and usage rights are not known for all of them.  
**I do not own any of the wallpapers listed in this repo.**  
If you stumble upon art or photos that you own or that you know and show that special rights have to be used to use or share them, **let me known and I will remove them immediately and without question!**

Otherwise, fell very free to take any of these and use them as you want in your configs :-)
